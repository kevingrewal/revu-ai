I want to create a Fullstack app using the existing project structure (React/TS Frontend + Python/Flask Backend). This app, called Revu AI, is an aggregated web app that displays the hottest products on the market based on Sentiment analysis of user reviews across various publically accessible data sources (ie. Amazon, Ebay, Tiktok, Etsy, etc.). Each product is given a AI rating on a scale of 10 based on the sentiment of it's aggregated reviews and number of reviews. I imagine the home page of the website is an aesthetic grid of hottest products sorted from "hottest" first. Each cell displays the rating of the product, a picture of the product, and other relevant metadata like price, description, category, etc. The user should be able to click on the cell to navigate to a new page with the information about this product, link to navigate and purchase, including pros and cons list, snippets of relevant reviews/sources for these pros and cons, an AI chat bot to ask follow up questions about the product. There should also be other endpoints the user can visit such as /categories that has a similar grid view but is instead sorted by categories, allowing users to find hottest products under a specific category. Ultimately, this app is a all-in-one stop shop for users trying to streamline purchases of products without having to do the extensive research behind it.
